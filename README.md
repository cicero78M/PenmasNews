# PenmasNews

This repository contains a minimal Android application skeleton written in Kotlin.
It demonstrates the core structure for a news production workflow app. Several
features are represented as placeholder classes.

## Building the App

This project uses Gradle. Because the Android SDK isn't bundled in this
repository, build and run it using Android Studio with the SDK installed.

```
# From the project root
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Open the project in Android Studio to edit and run on a device or emulator.
